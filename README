<<<<<<<<<---------------  FIRST THINGS FIRST --------------->>>>>>>>>
 ___________________________________________________________________
|  You need to be in the same directory as this README else 	    |
|  some of the scripts will fail.				    |
|								    |
|  First, run							    |
|  	make clean						    |
|  to clean up everything.  It should already be clean, but 	    |
|  you may run it if you want a fresh start at any point.	    |
|								    |
|  Then, if you want to remove my old results run		    |
|	./cleanResults				        	    |

<<<<<<<<<--  TO COMPILE THE JAVA FILES AND GENERATE DATA  -->>>>>>>>>
 ___________________________________________________________________
|  Now, type							    |
|  	make							    |
|  to recompile all the Java classes and then generate the data	    |
|  Alternatively, you could run					    |
|  	javac *.java				   		    |
|  	./generateInput			    			    |
|  instead of make because that's all it does anyway		    |
|  								    |
|  It is also possible to generate a single file with the number    |
|  of items you want.						    |
|	java getRandoms num > outputFile			    |
|  will do the trick.  If you want it sorted, you can use the 	    |
|  following commands:						    |
|        sort -g yourFile > temp				    |
|	 mv temp yourFile					    |
|  Reverse sorting can be achieved by adding the -r switch to sort  |

<<<<<<<<<------- TO RUN THE SORTS AND STORE THE DATA ------->>>>>>>>>
 ___________________________________________________________________
|  To run ALL the sorts, run					    |
|   ./runSorts					     		    |
|___________________________________________________________________|


<<<<<<<<<-------------  RUNNING INDIVIDUAL SORTS -------------->>>>>>>>>
 _______________________________________________________________________
|  If you wish to run a sort individually, the format is as follows:	|
|    java SORTTYPE 'data/{random,reverse,sorted}/#of items' '#of items'	|
|, substituting proper values.  i.e.					|
|    java QSort data/random/32 32					|
|    									|
|    									|
|  OPTIONAL:  if you want to output the sorted data to a file in order	|
|  to verify the correctness of the sort, you would want to simply add	|
|  another argument to the java call:  the file to write to.		|
|  EXAMPLE:								|
|     java Insertion data/sorted/64 64 64.output			|
|  This would perform insertion sort on 64 sorted numbers and print	|
|  the results in a file called 64.output in the current directory.	|
